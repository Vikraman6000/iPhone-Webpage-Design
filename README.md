# iPhone-Webpage-Design

Comprehensive Webpage Design that provides information on iPhone models, News, and Announcements.

The Webpage is live at ...

Contains collection of Html files with CSS styling linked,
contains five pages that displays basic information about iPhones. 
The design feels quite attractive and does not support smaller devices, 
no backend development included.

If you want to add new features or implement backend for the design, 
Feel free to fork and it is much appreciated.

The sole ownership of the code belongs to me.
